### Work in process  {style=text-align:center}

In a previous research, my research group analyzed the **Business Administrators Network** in a general way. So, we think that this new research should focus in one or two sectors **(Commerce and/or Agricultural Sectors)** due to previous results. These results showed that there are several strong links between these two sectors which motivates us to choose them. In addition, we focused in firms based in tax havens from these sectors.
