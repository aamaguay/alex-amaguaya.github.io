In this analysis, I wanted to analyze the behavior of people on Twitter regarding corruption cases in Ecuador and discover which were the groups that dominated this topic on Twitter. I also used a Centrality Metric like \u0026ldquo;Eigen Centrality\u0026rdquo; and the Modularity as a metric for clustering.\nNetwork by clusters The nodes and text size are based in the Eigen Centrality value; the links between nodes represent the number of mentions in a tweet. Also, the nodes color is based on the modularity metric. And using this clustering metric I found 20 clusters. As you can see, the main clusters are about state prosecutor\u0026rsquo;s office, government, political parties, hospitals, statal assembly, TV channels.\nMoreover, the main nodes in the network are:\n State prosecutor\u0026rsquo;s office  Fiscalia Ecuador Diana Salazar   Hospitals  IessEc Jorge Wated   Government  Otto Sonnenholzner Maria Paula Romo Juan Sebastián Roldán Lenin   Political parties  Mashi Rafael   Statal assembly  Asamblea Ecuador   TV channels  Teleamazonas    A few days later, I made a similar analysis but I used the hashtag #QuienRepartioLosHospitales, and this new data was from 2020-08-13 to 2020-08-16. During these days there were many corruption accusations directed to the Minister of Government (Maria Paula Romo) and caused that the main actor from the network change.\nNetwork by clusters As you can see, in the network there are 2 groups that dominate the discussion on twitter on these days. The first group is in top of graph and its principal actors are Maria Paula Romo, Lenin, Fiscalia Ecuador. The second group is the bottom and its principal actors are Rafael Correa and many TV channels.\n","date":1604696400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604696400,"objectID":"27811297e8b10f8bc3fb63e2b8a5b57b","permalink":"https://aamaguay.github.io/blog/post/corruption-cases-in-ecuador/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T21:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/post/corruption-cases-in-ecuador/","section":"post","summary":"I made a Social Network Analysis of the main actors using Twitter data of hashtags about corruption in Ecuador.","tags":["Networks"],"title":"Corruption cases in ecuador: A Network Approach using Twitter Data","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This work is being reviewed by the Inter-American Development Bank.\nThanks for waiting!

A characteristic very commonly affected when a natural disaster occurs is the geographic distribution of the affected areas and their surroundings. In this research, We\u0026rsquo;re estimating some metrics using Movistar Phone Data such as Concentration Index and Resilience Index. These metrics could use like risk indicators in Ecuador. After of this, we focus to predict which is the most affected canton using several Machine Learning techniques.\nIn the following graph, we show a general analysis using records behavior and communication towers. We separated the graph into 2 parts: During the earthquake and after this. Records behavior is based in user records and communication towers in the active towers. April 15 to 18 corresponds to the period during the earthquake, while July 15 to 17 belong earthquake later period.\nAnd in these graphs, we show the Concentration Index of the most and less populated cantons of Manabi.
